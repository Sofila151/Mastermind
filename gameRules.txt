Welcome to Mastermind, sofia!

The game rules are simple: I will pick 3 colors and place them in a specific order.
You will have 7 tries to figure out what I selected.

Pegs on the side of the board will indicate if you have selected:
the right color but wrong place,
the right place but wrong color, or
wrong color and wrong place.

A black peg indicates a Code Peg of the right color and in the right position.
A white peg indicates a Code Peg of the right color but in the wrong position.
No peg means that color does not appear in the secret code.

To begin, you will choose from 3 colors (Red, Blue, and Green)
and type them in the order you think I put them in.
You can enter your guess like this:'red', 'green', or 'blue'.
